  Stage 1: Basic Window and Game Loop
   1. Set up a window: I'll use the minifb library to create a window for rendering.
   2. Create a game loop: This will be a simple loop that keeps the window open and responsive.
   3. Initial rendering: I will draw a solid color to the window to confirm it's working.

  Stage 2: Player and World
   1. Define `Player`: A struct to hold the player's position and viewing angle.
   2. Define `World`: A simple 2D map to represent the level layout.
   3. Player movement: Implement basic movement logic (forward, backward, turning).

  Stage 3: 3D Rendering with Raycasting
   1. Implement Raycasting: I'll write the core raycasting logic to calculate what the player sees.
   2. Render Walls: Draw the walls on the screen based on the raycasting results.
   3. Render Floor and Ceiling: Add a simple floor and ceiling.

  Stage 4: Code Separation
   1. `GameState` struct: Create a struct to hold all the game's state (player, world, etc.).
   2. `Renderer` struct: Create a struct responsible only for drawing the GameState.
   3. Refactor: Separate the game logic (updating state) from the rendering logic. This is key for future multiplayer and AI development.
